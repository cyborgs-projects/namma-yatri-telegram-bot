### Project Title: App-less Ride Booking Telegram Bot

### Theme: Namma Yatri

### Project Description

We developed a Telegram bot for Namma Yatri that offers a hassle-free booking experience to customers who do not want to download the app. The bot is designed with a simple user interface and offers features such as booking a cab, help and support, language settings, and access to booking history.

Users can access the bot through the Telegram app and select the "book a cab" option to initiate the booking process. They can then input their pickup and drop-off locations, along with any additional requests they may have. Once the booking is confirmed, users receive a confirmation message through the bot.

Our solution also offers seamless help and support to users through the bot. Users can access the help and support option to receive assistance with any issues they may face during the booking process.

To cater to a diverse audience, we have included language settings in the bot. This feature allows users to select their preferred language and receive booking instructions in that language.

Finally, our solution includes access to booking history, enabling users to view their past bookings through the bot.

In summary, our Telegram bot solution offers a user-friendly, scalable, and convenient alternative to installing native app.
